# SE-Assignment-6
 Python Basics
What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It is dynamically typed and supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Some of its key features include:

Readability: Python’s syntax is clear and intuitive, making it easy to read and write.
Ease of Learning: Its simple syntax and large standard library make it accessible to beginners.
Versatility: Python can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more.
Extensive Libraries: It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that speed up development.
Examples of use cases:

Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science: With libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Artificial Intelligence: Leveraging TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
Scripting and Automation: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Installing Python
Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

Windows:

Download the Python installer from the official Python website.
Run the installer. Ensure to check the box “Add Python to PATH” before clicking “Install Now.”
Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and typing:
bash
Copy code
python --version
This should display the installed Python version.
macOS:

Install Python using Homebrew (a package manager). Open Terminal and type:
bash
Copy code
brew install python
Verify the installation by typing:
bash
Copy code
python3 --version
Linux:

Install Python using the package manager. For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), type:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
Verify the installation by typing:
bash
Copy code
python3 --version
Setting up a virtual environment:

Create a virtual environment by navigating to your project directory and typing:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
bash
Copy code
myenv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
Python Syntax and Semantics
Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

python
Copy code
print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:

print(): This is a built-in function that outputs the string provided to the console.
"Hello, World!": This is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.
Data Types and Variables
List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

Basic Data Types:

int: Integer numbers (e.g., 1, -5, 42)
float: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001)
str: String (e.g., "hello", "Python")
bool: Boolean values (True or False)
list: Ordered collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
dict: Dictionary of key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 30})
Script:

python
Copy code
# Integer
age = 30
# Float
height = 5.9
# String
name = "Alice"
# Boolean
is_student = True
# List
scores = [90, 85, 88]
# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

print(age, height, name, is_student)
print(scores)
print(person)
Control Structures
Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an if-else statement and a for loop.

Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions.

Example:

python
Copy code
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
Loops:
Loops allow you to repeat code multiple times.

Example of a for loop:

python
Copy code
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
Functions in Python
What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, reducing repetition, and improving readability.

Function Example:

python
Copy code
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)
Lists and Dictionaries
Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Differences:

Lists are ordered collections of items accessed by index. They can contain duplicate elements.
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and are used to access values.
Script:

python
Copy code
# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)  # Add an element
print(numbers)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
person["age"] = 31  # Update value
print(person)
Exception Handling
What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling allows you to manage errors gracefully and prevent the program from crashing.

Example:

python
Copy code
try:
    value = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / value
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
finally:
    print("Execution complete.")
Modules and Packages
Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the math module.

Modules are files containing Python code. They can define functions, classes, and variables.
Packages are collections of modules organized in directories. They help in structuring and organizing code.
Example using the math module:

python
Copy code
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
print(math.pi)        # Output: 3.141592653589793
File I/O
How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Reading from a file:

python
Copy code
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:

python
Copy code
lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]

with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")
